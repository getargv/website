<p>
  <code>getargv</code> has five flags, three of which are purely information about itself. You use the standard <kbd>-0</kbd> flag to print arguments <samp class="null">␀</samp> separated, the <kbd>-s</kbd> flag to strip leading arguments, the <kbd>-v</kbd> flag to print <code>getargv</code>'s version, and either of <kbd>-h</kbd> or <kbd>-?</kbd> to print a usage string. That's it, that's the whole interface.
