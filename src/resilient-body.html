          <h3>Correctness as the First Priority</h3>
          <p>My impetus for <abbr title="I wound up adapting it from existing code, but I set out to create a tool">building</abbr> <code>getargv</code> was to parse a <abbr title="Process ID">PID</abbr>'s arguments that I didn't control, in a script; which required me to consider the different ways that the process could have been created. In doing so, I found some surprising edge cases which no-one else seems to have handled correctly, but <code>getargv</code> does.</p>
          <p>The test suite for <code>getargv</code> is currently <samp><getargv-stats />×</samp> <abbr title="as measured in lines">as big</abbr> as the source for the program itself. With <samp>100%</samp> line, function, and branch coverage. And I'm still expanding the test suite.</p>
          <p>Out of curiosity I went and looked for every use of <var>KERN_PROCARGS2</var> I could find on the internet. Every single case where the arguments are considered, is incorrect. <a href="/hallofshame.html"><getargv-projects /> projects</a>, and every project that uses them as dependencies, all wrong.</p>
          <h3>Hall of Fame</h3>
          <p>The following projects are using <var>KERN_PROCARGS2</var> correctly to view processes' arguments, if you'd like to be on the list, might I suggest using <a href="/dylib.html"><code>libgetargv</code></a>, alternatively you can point me to your repo so that I can verify and add you to the list.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>getargv</code> and <code>libgetargv</code></li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Edge cases handled by <code>getargv</code></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Target process has an empty <code>argv[0]</code></li>
            <li>Target process has empty arguments</li>
            <li>Target process has no arguments</li>
            <li>Target process has huge arguments</li>
            <li>Invalid target <abbr title="Process ID">PID</abbr></li>
            <li>Insufficient permissions to target <abbr title="Process ID">PID</abbr></li>
            <li>Incorrect flags for <code>getargv</code></li>
            <li>System out of memory</li>
            <li>Any argument encoding that doesn't use <samp class="nul">␀</samp> as a valid char</li>
