  <code>getargv</code> runs in approx <getargv-speed /> on an M2 MacBook Air as measured by <code>hyperfine</code>. It does this by utilizing a zero-copy single-scan algorithm to run in <code>O(n)</code> time where <var>n</var> is the length of the arguments passed to the process you are inspecting, in Bytes. <code>getargv</code> allocates <abbr title="if the kern.argmax sysctl <= ARG_MAX a static buffer is used so no allocation is done">at-most</abbr> one <abbr title="usually ~1MiB">relatively small</abbr> block of memory, and stops reading the buffer once it finds the end of the process' arguments. <code>getargv</code> also prints the arguments to <var>stdout</var> using pointers back to the original buffer, without copying.
