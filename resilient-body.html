          <h3>Correctness as the First Priority</h3>
          <p>My impetus for <abbr title="I wound up adapting it from existing code, but I set out to create a tool">building</abbr> <code>getargv</code> was to parse a <abbr title="Process ID">PID</abbr>'s arguments that I didn't control, in a script; which required me to consider the different ways that the process could have been created. In doing so, I found some surprising edge cases which no-one else seems to have handled correctly, but <code>getargv</code> does.</p>
          <p>The test suite for <code>getargv</code> is currently <samp>1.92Ã—</samp> <abbr title="as measured in lines">as big</abbr> as the source for the program itself. With <samp>100%</samp> line, function, and branch coverage. And I'm still expanding the test suite.</p>
          <p>Out of curiosity I went and looked for every use of <var>KERN_PROCARGS2</var> I could find on the internet. Every single case where the arguments are considered, is incorrect. 88 projects, and every project that uses them as dependencies, all wrong.</p>
          <h3>Hall of shame</h3>
          <p>I've collected the projects that are incorrectly using the output of <var>KERN_PROCARGS2</var> <a href="/hallofshame.html">here</a>.</p>
          <h3>Edge cases handled by <code>getargv</code></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Target process has an empty <code>argv[0]</code></li>
            <li>Target process has empty arguments</li>
            <li>Target process has no arguments</li>
            <li>Target process has huge arguments</li>
            <li>Invalid target <abbr title="Process ID">PID</abbr></li>
            <li>Insufficient permissions to target <abbr title="Process ID">PID</abbr></li>
            <li>Incorrect flags for <code>getargv</code></li>
            <li>System out of memory</li>
          </ul>
